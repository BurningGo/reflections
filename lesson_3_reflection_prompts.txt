When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - In case the remore repository is managed by many people, source update can be quite frequent. 
	Sometimes, there can be some updates from other people which you do not want to download immediately. 


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork : create a repository in GitHub which is a copy of other repository in Gitbhub.  
    clone : create a local repository copying a repository from Github
    branches : There can be serveral branches in a single repository. At a specific commit point, a new branch can be created 
               to develop codes in a different direction. It is kind of paths thorugh which codes are updated. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
